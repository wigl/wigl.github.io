### 104: Whats new in Xcode

1. App Thinning
 - Bitcode
 - Slicing
 - On Demand Resources

2. Debugging and Profiling Tools
 - Location Instrument
 - Metal System Trace
 - Address Sanitizer


### 106: Whats new in swift

1. Recursive enum can marked 'indirect'

2. Error Handling


### 401: Swift and Objective-C Interoperability 

### 403: Improving your Existing Apps with Swift

### 404: App Thinning in Xcode

#### App Slicing
1. Executable Code(armv7, armv7s, arm64)
2. Resources(image, Metal, OpenGL, Audio, Other Data)
3. Named Data
 - Store arbitrary file content
 - Classify according to hardware capabilities
 - Use NSDataAsset class to retrieve content in your application

#### On Demand Resources
 - Asset packs are built by Xcode
 - Can contain any non-executable assets Hosted by the App Store
 - Downloaded when needed
 - Reclaimed as appropriate
 - Device-thinned just like the other content

#### Build Workflow
1. Build
 - Xcode Build and Run automatically thins resources for the active run destination.
 - Supported for all simulator and device run destinations.
 - ENABLE_ONLY_ACTIVE_RESOURCES target build setting
2. Distributing Thinned Applications
 - App Store Purchase
 - TestFlight
 - Ad-hoc/Enterprise Distribution
 - Xcode Server
3. Ad-hoc/Enterprise Distribution
 - Export thinned variants for all compatible devices
 - Save for Ad-Hoc/Enterprise with distribution **manifest** option


Note:
> 移动网络不能下载大于150M App的官方定义： over-the-air size limits


### 406: UI Testing in Xcode

1. UI testing
  - Find and interact with UI elements
  - Validate UI properties and state
  
2. UI recording
3. Test reports
4. Core Technologies
  - XCTest
  - Accessibility

#### XCUIApplication

- Proxy for the tested application
- Tests run in a separate process 
- Always spawns a new process


### 407: Implementing UI Designs in Interface Builder


1. Design Time
 - Stack Views, Dynamic Type(Font body, headline...), Advanced Navigation(option+shift+click), 

2. Build Time
 - *XML Documents* Build to *Nib Files.*
 - Loading Storyboards At Run Time.
 - *Performance.* Nib files loaded on demand.
 - *Reuse.* Nib files enable reuse.
 - *Life cycle.* Know when objects are created.

3. Run Time


### 414: Building Better Apps with Value Types in Swift

**Reference Semantics**

*Copy When You Need It*

1. Manual Copying
2. Defensive Copying in Cocoa and Objective-C
 - NSDictionary calls -copy on its keys
 - Property copy attribute provides defensive copying on assignment

*Immutability*: Cocoa[Touch] has a number of immutable classes

- NSDate, NSURL, UIImage, NSNumber, etc. 
- Improved safety (no need to use copy)

**Value Semantics**

1. Variables Are Logically Distinct
 - Mutating one variable of some value type will never affect a different variable

2. Value types should implement Equatable
 
*Copies Are Cheap*

1. Copying a low-level, fundamental type is constant time.
 - Int, Double, etc
2. Copying a struct, enum, or tuple of value types is constant time.
 - CGPoint, etc.
3. Extensible data structures use **copy-on-write**
 - Copying involves a fixed number of reference-counting operations
 - String, Array, Set, Dictionary, etc.

*A Value Type Can Contain a Reference*

1. Immutable References
 - Use deep equality comparisons(`isEqual`)
2. References to Mutable Objects
 - Copy-on-Write

*Copy-on-Write*

````swift
// Mutable Object; NSobject
struct BezierPath {
    private var _path = UIBezierPath()
    
    var pathForReading: UIBezierPath {
        return _path
    }
    
    var pathForWriting: UIBezierPath {
        mutating get {
            _path = _path.copy() as! UIBezierPath
            return _path
        }
    }
}

extension BezierPath {
    var isEmpty: Bool {
        return pathForReading.isEmpty
    }
    
    mutating func addLineToPoint(point: CGPoint) {
        self.pathForWriting.addLineToPoint(point: point)
    }
}

// Uniquely Referenced Swift Objects
// The isKnownUniquelyReferenced(_:) function is useful for implementing the copy-on-write optimization for the deep storage of value types:

class Box<T> {
    let unbox: T
    init(_ value: T) {
        unbox = value
    }
}

class Foo: NSObject {
    var count: Int = 0
}

struct Counter {
    private var _counter = Box(Foo())
    
    mutating func increment() {
        // copy the reference only if necessary
        if !isKnownUniquelyReferenced(&_counter) {
            let old = _counter
            _counter = Box(Foo())
            _counter.unbox.count = old.unbox.count
        }
        
        _counter.unbox.count += 1
    }
    
    var value: Int {
        return _counter.unbox.count
    }
}

### 718: Building Responsive and Efficient Apps with GCD

1. Quality of Service Introduction
 - QoS can be specified on Blocks and on queues 
 - dispatch_async() automatically propagates QoS 
 - Some priority inversions are resolved automatically
 - > 在串行队列中添加高优先级的任务，如果当前队列还有低优先级的任务，则会提高队列的整体优先级，直到该任务到达。
 
2. GCD Design Patterns with QoS
3. Threads, Queues, and Run Loops
4. GCD and Crash Reports
